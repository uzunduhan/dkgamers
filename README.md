In this project, we built a site where people can view gaming news and games. It has an admin panel to control users, games and news. Users who are members will be able to add the games they like to their favorites and comment on the games. We will do the project using .Net 6. First, we will design the site. Then we will make the necessary database connections and coding for the project.
